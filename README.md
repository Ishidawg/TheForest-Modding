## Mods

I've created four mods so far. They are intended to modify the behavior of the flashlight, torch, water, and inventory (without making the game easier). These are just small tweaks to maintain the vanilla difficulty. Below are the changes for each:

### Flashlight
- Increased the **intensity** (*or brightness, if you prefer*) of the light by approximately `222%`. This was done by *multiplying* the original intensity (`0.45f`) by `2f`, resulting in `1.0f`, and then to `1.45f`.
- Increased the **range** (*how far the light goes*) by around `20%`, by multiplying the final range by `1.2f`.
- Doubled the **battery lifespan** by cutting the usage cost in *half* (from `0.1f`), resulting in *20 minutes of light*.

### Torch
- Doubled the **intensity** (*or brightness*) of the light.
- Doubled the **lifespan** of the fire by halving the fuel consumption, resulting in *08 minutes of light*.

### Inventory
- **Hard-capped** the limit of all countable items to `1000`.
- Tweaked the `BowController` to actually *see* that the inventory can **handle more** than 30 arrows.

### Water
- **Removed** the water blur post-effect.

If you want all mods in *one package*, download the `Merged` version. Otherwise, choose the individual ones you want: `flashlight`, `torch`, `inventory`, or `water`.

## Installation

### Windows:
Go to your **game‚Äôs root folder**, then open the correct folder depending on the *version* you're playing.
**For example:**
- 64-bit (x86_64): `Steam\steamapps\common\The Forest\TheForest_Data\Managed`.
- 32-bit (x86): `Steam\steamapps\common\The Forest\TheForest_Data32\Managed`.
- VR version: `Steam\steamapps\common\The Forest\TheForestVR_Data\Managed`.

*Make a backup of the original DLL so that if you want to uninstall the mod, you can restore it easily.*

**Copy** the DLL that you have downloaded (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`) to the `Managed` folder and **replace-it**.

Done! You folder should look like this:

</div>

### Linux
Same process as Windows. The final path should look like: `/home/yourusername/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/The Forest/TheForest_Data/Managed/`

*Make a backup of the original DLL so that if you want to uninstall the mod, you can restore it easily.*

**Copy** the DLL that you have downloaded (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`) to the `Managed` folder and **replace-it**.

Done! You folder should look like this:

## How to merge yourself

To be honest, the only method I found to work is the *old-fashioned cowboy way*: **copy and paste**. I initially tried using the **Merge with Assembly** in dnSpy, but I can't get it to work. So my tip is *real simple*, just more *time demanding* (about 5 minutes): **Copy & Paste**.

You will need the [dnSpy]("https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy") to edit game assemblie. Just download it, then open the `Assembly-CSharp.dll`. Now is just copy and paste. 

Look at the mod that you want, let's say you want to merge the `flashlight` mod.

Go to the [`BatteryBasedLight.cs`](https://github.com/Ishidawg/TheForest-Modding/blob/main/001_flashlight/003Intensity_Range_BatteryCost/BatteryBasedLight.cs) and copy the changes (battery cost, intensity and range). Then in `dnSpy`, open your `Assembly-CSharp.dll` ‚Üí `TheForest.items.World` ‚Üí `BatteryBasedLight`, now with the *mouse right button* click on `Edit Class (C#)...` and just do the changes you want, like this:

<div align="center">
    <img alt="Torch-vanilla" src="https://i.imgur.com/P8E3ZnP.png" width="900" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
</div>
<div align="center">
    <img alt="Torch-vanilla" src="https://i.imgur.com/jEZbOpm.png" width="900" />
</div>

When you are done with editing, click on `File` ‚Üí `Save All` and then `Ok`. That's it! You've made your **own mod** by merging what you want into your game.

## Testing
The **last (old) version** of all mod had **so many issues**, like the classic laser beam coming from the flashlight or the flashlight just does not working at all. You couldn't shoot your arrows! What an absurd! So I did the testing of each mod one by one. The conclusions are that this time is all working fine even in multiplayer, you and your friends can play with all of them having the mod or not, **will work fine**. There is no more laser beam, green screen after installing the mod or even the broken bow, **but please**, if you see **any bug**, *report and I will fix it*. here are some of the testing screenshots during testing.
